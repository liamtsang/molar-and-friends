      <p class="body pb-2: md:pb-4">
        We believe in making access to dental care seamless and simple. That's why our dedicated team will submit dental insurance claims on your behalf as a courtesy, regardless of your dental insurance provider. We participate with most major PPO dental insurance plans. To determine if we're included in your coverage network and to learn about your plan benefits, we encourage you to contact your insurance provider directly.   
      </p>
      <p class="body pb-2: md:pb-4">
        We strive to deliver the best care at the most reasonable cost, and our team will work with you to ensure you are informed about all payment expectations. It is important to note that our relationship is with you and not directly with your insurance provider.  You are responsible for understanding your dental insurance policy and for any portion that is not covered by your insurance. Payment is due at the time services are rendered unless prior arrangements have been made. We accept major credit cards and cash payments.
